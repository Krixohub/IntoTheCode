IntoTheCode is a general parser class library for .NET.
With the IntoTheCode library, making parsers is fast and flexible. Parse protocols, text formats and domain languages.

### Syntax
* Define your syntax in the well known Backus-Naur Form.
* The form is well suited for both documentation and parsing!
* Developers can easily review the syntax.

### Input 
Use the IntoTheCode parser to read all kind of structured text or code. The syntax (and the grammar) of the text can be verified with the IntoTheCode Parser.

### Reading
Reading code with IntoTheCode is like reading objects with the System.Xml.Linq namespace. Very similar to reading a Microsoft XDocument representation of XML.
