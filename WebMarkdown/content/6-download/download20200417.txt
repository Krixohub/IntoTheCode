**IntoTheCode**<br/>
IntoTheCode is everything you need to make parsers, when you know how it works.

**IntoTheCodeMarkdown**<br/>
IntoTheCodeMarkdown contains build events to produce markdown dokumentation for the [Classes](/doc/classes) page. The IntoTheCode project generates the \bin\Debug\IntoTheCode.xml documentation file; This file is filtered and translated to markdown.

**IntoTheCodeUnitTest**<br/>
Unit Tests, and some of them are nice examples of code as well.

**TestApp**<br/>
Does not work now. This project needs the two dll's (MoehlData.Basic.dll and MoehlData.ClientWpf.dll)
